## This repository aims to  explain about myself, for the ones who want to know me

Hello! My name is Larissa.. as stated previously, i'm going to introduce me on this repository:
So, let's begin-I'm a *90's kid*, passionate about "old music", animals, colors and smiles; I describe myself as a creative person, always trying to create versions of things or even, create new things, to help others, to solve problems, or just for trying. 

Some can infer that I'm a extrovert person (well, I actually am, heven't been for a while, but necessity forced me to), a smile person, a talkative person, but, most of the time, I'm drowned on my own thoughts and imagination, and when needed, ***I'm fair, and though.. justice is a term that best describe myself on stressful moments***.

My work field includes graphic design, web design, arts and customer service; I'm a music person, nostalgia person, a dog person and the most important of all: I'm a **FAMILY** person: my main reason to live, is to have my family together, laughin and been happy.
